    <h1>Txti has retired</h1>
    <p>Txti was created in 2014 with a simple and benevolent mission:to play a part in a more <br>
        globally accessible internet.Our slogen was "fast wab pages for everybody," and it <br> worked!
        Txti served millions of people, with well over half a million fast web pages created. <br>
        since then, the whole world has change. Now, there is less need for web pages that <br> work
        on flip phones, and more need for trustworthiness and safety on the internet.As txti <br>
        is not able to keep up with this need,it's time for it to step aside to ensure we're not <br>
        causing harm.

        simple wasn't able to maintain. there are many lessons learned here, but i am grateful to <br> have 
        been part of a <a href="https://www.omegle.com/">special era</a> of the internet's evolution. <br>
